## Overview
This project is built on a [Gemini API integration framework](https://ai.google.dev/examples/pipet-code-agent).
I've enhanced the original framework with:
- Custom commands for specialized use cases
- Refined prompts with clear instructions
- Improved readability through formatting and content structuring

## Key Features
- Code summary: Quickly analyze code purpose, functionality, and logic
- Code comments: Add explanatory comments that focus on intent rather than restating code
- Code review: Identify potential bugs and suggest improvements
- Naming assistance: Recommend meaningful function names with reasoning

## Built With
- TypeScript
- Gemini API (2.0 Flash model)
